# Habit Tracker 
This is a presonal project developed solely by me. It is a simple and intuitive habit tracking web app that also supports a native android deployment. It uses Firebase for the backend user authentication as well as Firestore for storage of user-created workout plans as well as real-time logging of progress data.
